### Serial Port Assistant Software Download and Use

**Download Serial Port Assistant Software**

The serial port assistant software can be downloaded by yourself. Take Mobaxterm as an example below.

网盘路径：

``` 
h618_data\5-DevelopmentTools\UART_DebugTool\MobaXterm_Portable_v20.3.zip
```

Software official website download:https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/



**Mobaxterm操作步骤**

1. Create a new session window.
2. Select the session window type as "serial".
3. Select the serial port COM number (open the Windows Device Manager -> Ports interface to view the COM number).
4. Select the serial port baud rate as 115200.
5. Start the session window.

## ADB

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a debugging bridge tool for the Android system, which supports connecting to devices via USB or network, and can realize device management and debugging operations such as application installation, file transfer, and command execution.



### Debug Cable and Interface

- Debug cable: Use a USB TYPE-C data cable.
- Debug interface: The USB TYPE-C interface of the motherboard.

Connect the computer and the board with a TYPE-C data cable. If the following device is recognized in the Device Manager, it is normal. If not, try changing the computer's USB port or the data cable first.

### ADB Tool Acquisition and Installation

**Tool Acquisition**

The ADB software tool can be obtained from the KICKPI network disk, for Windows platform, located in the network disk directory:

``` 
h618_data\5-DevelopmentTools\ADB_Tool\adb-tools.rar
```



**Installation Steps**

1. Unzip the adb-tools.rar compressed package, for example, to the path D:\ADB Tool\adb-tools.
2. Open the command line window and switch to the unzip directory:

```
ADB$ cd D:\ADB Tool\adb-tools
```

3. Run the command. A successful run indicates a successful installation.

```
ADB$ adb --version
```

Example:

```
PS D:\ADB Tool\adb-tools> .\adb.exe --version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.40
Version 4797878
Installed as D:\ADB Tool\adb-tools\adb.exe
```

### ADB Debugging

## SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to establish a secure remote connection on an insecure network. It provides encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Through SSH, users can securely manage remote servers, transfer files, and access remote resources.

Connect the board to the network and view the board's IP address through the serial port or the router's background.

**There are three ways to view the IP address after the development board starts:：**

1. **Connect an HDMI monitor, log in to the system, and use the ifconfig eth0 command to view the IP address.**
2. **Enter the ifconfig eth0 command in the debug serial port terminal to view the IP address.**
3. **If there is no debug serial port or HDMI monitor, you can also view the IP address of the development board's network port through the router's management interface. However, many people often cannot see the development board's IP address normally using this method. If you cannot see it, the debugging methods are as follows:**

1. **First, check whether the Linux system has started normally. If the blue light of the development board is flashing, it usually means the system has started normally; otherwise, the system has not started normally.**
2. **Check whether the network cable is plugged in tightly, or try replacing the network cable.**
3. **Try replacing the router (many problems with routers have been encountered, such as the router being unable to assign an IP address normally, or having assigned an IP address normally but not being visible in the router).**
4. **If there is no router to replace, you can only connect an HDMI monitor or use the debug serial port to view the IP address.**


**In addition, it should be noted that the development board's DHCP automatic IP address allocation does not require any settings.**

### User Information

The default username and password are as follows:

| System   | Username | Password   |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Ubuntu | kickpi | kickpi |
| Ubuntu | root   | root   |

``` shell
ssh kickpi@<ip>
密码kickpi
```

**注意事项**

- 确保主板网络连接正常。
- 确保电脑能够正常 ping 通主板的 IP 地址。
- 确保输入的用户名和密码存在且正确。

## 常见问题

### 上电供电问题

当主板接入较多外设，导致功耗较高时，接入电源后，上电绿灯可能会较暗或不能保持常亮，系统启动也可能出现异常。

**解决方案**：这一般是电源供电问题，请检测对应电源的功耗是否足够，能否支持所连接的外设模块供电。



### ADB设备无法识别

进行ADB调试时，等板卡蓝灯闪烁时查看系统设备管理器是否识到是如下设备，

如果识别到的是未知设备，如图所示则需手动安装驱动
